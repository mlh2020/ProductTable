# React + Vite

## Overview

This project demonstrates a practical example of a React application using Vite. It features a table of products extracted from a provided dataset. Key functionalities include the ability to search for products and filter them based on their stock status.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and describe the "Thinking in React" philosophy.
- Use the five-step process as outlined by the React team to build a React application from scratch.
- Determine the type of data that should be managed as "state" and what should not.

## Building a React Application: "Thinking in React" Steps

1. **Componentize the User Interface:** Break down your user interface into distinct components.

2. **Build a Static Version:** Assemble a static version of your application using React, without focusing on interactivity.

3. **Determine the UI State:** Identify the simplest yet complete representation of the UI's state.

4. **State Ownership:** Ascertain where the state should reside. Determine which component should "own" the state.

5. **Inverse Data Flow:** Implement inverse data flow where necessary to ensure components are properly communicating.
